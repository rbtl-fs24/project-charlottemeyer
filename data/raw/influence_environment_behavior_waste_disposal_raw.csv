It was a sunny day so you were sitting on Polyterrasse. You had one bowl with a carton bottom and plastic lid, and one drink in a plastic bottle, as well as a can of Mate. Do you recycle any of these elements? Meaning not putting them in a regular trash?",What do you recycle?,What options do you choose?,"Later on the same hike, you see an empty bag of chips on the trail, which probably fell from another hiker's backpack. How likely is it that you would take it with you to throw it in a trash later?",What makes you decide if you will pick up the bag of chips to put it in a trash or not?,What do you do with your waste?,"Your friends just want to leave everything on the grass, how likely is it that you will go against what they are doing and push them to take the waste away?","Now, on the way to the tram station, there is a plastic bottle on the pavement. Do you take it to the next trash?",What makes you decide if you will pick up the plastic bottle to put it in a trash or not?,Do you think you have in general good recycling habits?...16,Is there anything you want to implement to improve your behavior towards waste?,Would this recycling be different if you would have very little amount of time until your next lecture or meeting starts?,Feedback
