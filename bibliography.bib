  abstract = {A questionnaire survey consisting of 2400 householders was performed on Abadan residents to evaluate their knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards solid waste (SW) reduction, source separation and recycling, collection and willingness to pay (WTP) for SW services. The study has also covered the relationship between demographic variables and KAP towards SW management. The data analyzed suggests that the studied community had a very positive attitude to take part in SW source separation and recycling plans. However, the respondents not only showed low intimate knowledge of different steps of SW management, but were also weak to take practices about these steps. The KAP of SW source separation and recycling was influenced by demographic factors of age, education level, gender and occupation. It was further found that education level and occupation were two significant factors affecting residents' WTP ({$\chi$}2=24.083, p-value {$<$}0.0001). In conclusion our study found that providing public with MSW infrastructures and improving citizens' awareness about SW source separation and recycling to promote SW recycling programs hold great promise for developing effective public campaigns and behavior-changing interventions. This has important implications in that the usual KAP of public proved inadequate in the case of SW source separation and recycling. The implementation of needs-based training programmes considering females as one of the main audience groups and determination of municipality needs are thereby highly advocated.},

  abstract = {The management of household solid waste is a growing concern related to public health and environmental damage. The study examined socio-demographic factors, perceptions, and attitudes that influence household waste management practices in Chitungwiza, Zimbabwe. Stratified and random sampling techniques were used to select 314 participants for the study. Data obtained from the survey were analyzed using descriptive and square Chi-square tests of association. 55.7\% of the 25--44~years of age group is responsible for managing waste at a household level. The results of a Chi-square test of independence suggested a strong significant association between gender, and willingness to pay for fortnight waste collection services (X2 (1)\,=\,8.119 p\,{$<$}\,0.017). 80.8\% of respondents who are self-employed use buckets and plastic bags as waste receptacle facilities compared to 66\% who are employed. Results of a fisher test indicate that there is an association between income, and waste receptacle used by participants (X2 (1)\,=\,8.977, p\,{$<$}\,.03). However, gender, age, and level of education have no association with waste receptacle facilities used by individuals. Environmental planners need to consider socio-demographic status in formulating strategies to improve waste management practices in the developing countries context. The study recommends that local authorities need to promote active community involvement as a driver for behavior change towards sustainable solid waste disposal practices in urban areas.},

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has an adverse effect on the environment. This epidemic's effect on the waste composition and management and the impacts of municipal solid waste management (MSWM) on disease transmission or controlling are considered a compelling experience of living in the COVID-19 pandemic that can effectively control the process. This systematic review research was conducted to determine the effects of COVID-19 on the quantity of waste and MSWM. Searches were conducted in three databases (using keywords covid 19, coronaviruses, and waste), and among the published articles from 2019 to 2021, 56 ones were selected containing information on the quantity and waste management during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results showed that COVID-19 caused the quantity variation and composition change of MSW. COVID-19 also has significant effects on waste recycling, medical waste management, quantity, and littered waste composition. On the other hand, the COVID-19 pandemic has changed waste compounds' management activities and waste generation sources. Recognizing these issues can help plan MSWM more efficiently and reduce virus transmission risk through waste.},
